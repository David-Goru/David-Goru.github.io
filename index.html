			I'm David Gómez, a 20 y/o student coursing the third year of Game Design and Development at UJI (Spain). Since I was 8 y/o I wanted to make games, and started trying to fulfill that dream by using PowerPoint as my first engine. Through the years I have been trying to learn better (and real) game engines, and in summer 2016 I started my first project with Unity: Hotel Tycoon. Since then, I haven't stopped working on games as a hobby with the objective to make it my job. I love the feeling when everything works just as you wanted to, and love to keep things organized, and coding let me feel and do that.
