			Happinessn't is a management game where the player has to extract, bottle and sell bottles of happiness.
			This game is one of my first big projects started during college. We were one of the 5 finalists at UJI Oculus 2019. I was the only programmer, and worked with one artist. In Happinessn't, vehicles routes are calculated using a BFS Algorithm which was implemented with the help of a college teacher.
