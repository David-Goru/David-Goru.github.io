			Vivaio is a shopping and farming management game where the player has to build a business focusing on selling products created on the farm.
			<br>This game is a two-people project with only one programmer (me) and one artist. We're currently working on it in a daily basis. We worked on the 2D version at the College Facilities (UJI's Espaitec) during 2020 thanks to the INAT GameLab. We've been implementing agile methodologies to make the communication and planification smoother.
			<br>The game was paused during the first semester of 2021 to focus on the <a class="small" href="./Final Project.html">Final Bachelor's Degree Project</a>. After finishing it, we decided to remake Vivaio as a 3D game.
