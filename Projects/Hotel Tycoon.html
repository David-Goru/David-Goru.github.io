		<div id="aboutme">
			Hotel Tycoon is a management game where the player has to build and maintain a hotel, hiring people, building rooms and facilities and buying resources.
			This game is my first Unity project and the first project to get played by more than 10k people. I'm the only programmer, and have worked with 2 modellers, one 2D artist and a sound and music composer. As my first project, it has a lot of bugs and is not stable at all. I stopped working on it once I started college.
